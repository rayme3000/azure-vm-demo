<p>
 **Be sure to remember the username and password you set, as it will be required to sign into your VM later. <br>
** When choosing the size of your VM, note that the more VCPUs and the larger the memory (Gib) you choose will increase both the performance and cost to run your VM. Choose accordingly.
